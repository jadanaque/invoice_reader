## Invoice Reader (PDFs)

This project is meant to **automate** the manual work that Supply Planners (at L'Or√©al Peru) used to do: extract data from PDF files to generate a needed report.

This work was manual (copy-paste) and very time consuming because no software/method worked for them due to the complexity and wide variety of the PDF files (invoices from plants). In total, when adding the time from the 3 supply planners, ~13 days a month were exclusively dedicated to process the PDF files.

With this app the processing time was minimized to ~5 minutes a month, in total.

P.S.: The data is confidential, so the data and reports generated are not shared in this repo.
